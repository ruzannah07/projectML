For this, I have used Keras which is a high-level Neural Networks API built on top of low level neural networks APIs like Tensorflow and Theano. As it is high-level, many things are already taken care of therefore it is easy to work with and a great tool to start with. [Here's the documentation for keras](https://keras.io/)\n\n# What is Deep learning?\nDeep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.\n\n\n# What are artificial neural networks?\nAn artificial neuron network (ANN) is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows through the network affects the structure of the ANN because a neural network changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output. ANNs are considered nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the complex relationships between inputs and outputs are modeled or patterns are found. ANN is also known as a neural network.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ZX05x1xYgaVoa4Vn2kKS9g.png\">"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5a1835cc73f103d85fe770ff84e0afae99ba692f","_cell_guid":"17fa9862-de9f-4964-a688-fe9e666f0fd5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A single neuron is known as a perceptron. It consists of a layer of inputs(corresponds to columns of a dataframe). Each input has a weight which controls the magnitude of an input.\nThe summation of the products of these input values and weights is fed to the activation function. Activation functions are really important for a Artificial Neural Network to learn and make sense of something really complicated and Non-linear complex functional mappings between the inputs and response variable. \n\nThey introduce non-linear properties to our Network.Their main purpose is to convert a input signal of a node in a A-NN to an output signal. That output signal now is used as a input in the next layer in the stack.  Specifically in A-NN we do the sum of products of inputs(X) and their corresponding Weights(W) and apply a Activation function f(x) to it to get the output of that layer and feed it as an input to the next layer.

Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network's weights. It is a generalization of the delta rule for perceptrons to multilayer feedforward neural networks.\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hassan_Al-Haj_Ibrahim/publication/235338024/figure/fig6/AS:299794191929349@1448487913220/Flow-chart-for-the-back-propagation-BP-learning-algorithm.png\">\n**Gradient Descent** - To explain Gradient Descent I’ll use the classic mountaineering example. Suppose you are at the top of a mountain, and you have to reach a lake which is at the lowest point of the mountain (a.k.a valley). A twist is that you are blindfolded and you have zero visibility to see where you are headed. So, what approach will you take to reach the lake? The best way is to check the ground near you and observe where the land tends to descend. This will give an idea in what direction you should take your first step. If you follow the descending path, it is very likely you would reach the lake.

Usually this is applied element-wise to the output of some other function, such as a matrix-vector product. In MLP usages, rectifier units replace all other activation functions except perhaps the readout layer. But I suppose you could mix-and-match them if you'd like. One way ReLUs improve neural networks is by speeding up training. The gradient computation is very simple (either 0 or 1 depending on the sign of x). Also, the computational step of a ReLU is easy: any negative elements are set to 0.0 -- no exponentials, no multiplication or division operations. Gradients of logistic and hyperbolic tangent networks are smaller than the positive portion of the ReLU. This means that the positive portion is updated more rapidly as training progresses. However, this comes at a cost. The 0 gradient on the left-hand side is has its own problem, called \"dead neurons,\" in which a gradient update sets the incoming values to a ReLU such that the output is always zero; modified ReLU units such as ELU (or Leaky ReLU etc.) can minimize this.
